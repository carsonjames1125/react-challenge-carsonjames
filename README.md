# React Portfolio - Carson James

## Description

This project was designed to test our skill and knowledge in React as well as other components from previous lessons. This application was built to show off our projects that we have created. Within the apllication there is an about me section, links to my social media accounts, and my github. The applications displayed are also linked to their respective pages and live URL's. The webpage uses React and other components to make it more user friendly and user responsive. The problem it solves is that it gives a resume a new look allowing people to view the page and get a better understadning of the skills I have through the use of including live look ins at the work we have completed.
